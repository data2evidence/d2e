# Load Athena Vocabularies Datasets

## Download Datasets
- Open [https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/start](https://athena.ohdsi.org/search-terms/start)
- Register (free), if needed
- Login

> ![](../images/vocab/AthenaDownload.png)

- Select **DOWNLOAD** button at top right of page
- Default datasets are automatically selected
- Confirm CDM version 5.x at top right
- Enter a name
- Click **DOWNLOAD**
- Await email with download link (typically within ~1 hour)
- Download ~174Mb zipfile to `Downloads` folder
- Run the following commands
```bash
GIT_BASE_DIR=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
VOCAB_DIR=$GIT_BASE_DIR/cache/vocab
ZIP_FILE="$(ls -tr ~/Downloads/vocabulary_download_v5*.zip | head -1)"
cd $VOCAB_DIR
unzip -o -d . "${ZIP_FILE}"
```
- remove additional file
```bash
rm CONCEPT_CPT4.csv
```

## Confirm Line Count Before Transformation
- Run command to output line count for each CSV file 
```
wc -l *.csv | sort -nr
```
- Output should be:
```
  130981848 total
  72754470 CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv
  47212425 CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv
   5975393 CONCEPT.csv
   2980116 DRUG_STRENGTH.csv
   2058224 CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv
       691 RELATIONSHIP.csv
       418 CONCEPT_CLASS.csv
        60 VOCABULARY.csv
        51 DOMAIN.csv
```
- Note that unzipped CSV file from Athena contains an extra new line that is empty.

## Transform csv files to expected format
- Escape existing double quotes
- Add double quotes around each value
- This transformation is done in case there is a literal string character e.g. `\t` or `\n` in the value.
- Enclosing the values in double quotes would prevent interpretation as a tab or newline.
- Move files to a folder named `transformed`
```
mkdir transformed
for CSV_FILE in *.csv; do sed "s/\"/\"\"/g;s/\t/\"\t\"/g;s/\(.*\)/\"\1\"/" $CSV_FILE >> ./transformed/$CSV_FILE; done
```

## Confirm Line Count of Transformed CSVs before ingestion
- Run command to output line count for each CSV file 
```bash
wc -l *.csv | sort
```
- Linecounts are similar to:
```
        51 DOMAIN.csv
        60 VOCABULARY.csv
       424 CONCEPT_CLASS.csv
       697 RELATIONSHIP.csv
   1669979 CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv
   2981808 DRUG_STRENGTH.csv
   6071643 CONCEPT.csv
  38570317 CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv
  72374968 CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv
 121669947 total
```
- Note that unzipped CSV file from Athena contains an extra new line that is empty.

## Load data to cdmvocab

- Run the following command in terminal to stop an alp docker container and start another container to load data
```bash
docker exec -it alp-dataflow-gen-worker prefect deployment run data_load_plugin/data_load_plugin --param options='{"files":[{"name": "CONCEPT_ANCESTOR","path": "/app/vocab/CONCEPT_ANCESTOR.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "concept_ancestor"},{"name": "CONCEPT_CLASS","path": "/app/vocab/CONCEPT_CLASS.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "concept_class"},{"name": "CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP","path": "/app/vocab/CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "concept_relationship"},{"name": "CONCEPT_SYNONYM","path": "/app/vocab/CONCEPT_SYNONYM.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "concept_synonym"},{"name": "CONCEPT","path": "/app/vocab/CONCEPT.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "concept"},{"name": "DOMAIN","path": "/app/vocab/DOMAIN.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "domain"},{"name": "DRUG_STRENGTH","path": "/app/vocab/DRUG_STRENGTH.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "drug_strength"},{"name": "RELATIONSHIP","path": "/app/vocab/RELATIONSHIP.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "relationship"},{"name": "VOCABULARY","path": "/app/vocab/VOCABULARY.csv", "truncate": "True", "table_name": "vocabulary"}],"schema_name":"cdmvocab","header":"true","delimiter":"\t","database_code": "alpdev_pg", "chunksize": "50000", "encoding": "utf_8"}'
```
- Docker container logs can be checked with the bash command `docker logs --tail 100 alp-dataflow-gen-worker`
- Once the flow is completed, the container logs the message "Finished in state Completed()"
- note: expected output is 
> COPY ${LINE_COUNT}

## Validation
- Confirm data loaded with by select count(*) from tables
```
docker exec -it alp-minerva-postgres-1 psql -h localhost -U postgres -p 5432 -d alpdev_pg --command "SELECT table_name, row_count FROM (SELECT 'concept_relationship' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.concept_relationship UNION SELECT 'concept_ancestor' AS table_name, count(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.concept_ancestor UNION SELECT 'concept_relationship' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.concept UNION SELECT 'relationship' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.relationship UNION SELECT 'concept_synonym' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.concept_synonym UNION SELECT 'vocabulary' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.vocabulary UNION SELECT 'domain' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.domain UNION SELECT 'drug_strength' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.drug_strength UNION SELECT 'concept_class' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM cdmvocab.concept_class) temp ORDER BY row_count DESC;"
```
- Expect output row_count similar to:
```
      table_name      | row_count 
----------------------+-----------
 concept_ancestor     |  72754469
 concept_relationship |  47212424
 concept              |   5975392
 drug_strength        |   2980115
 concept_synonym      |   2058223
 relationship         |       690
 concept_class        |       417
 vocabulary           |        59
 domain               |        50
(9 rows)

```

# Troubleshooting
## Repeat load
- To repeat, run "Load data to cdmvocab" commands in the sequence given
