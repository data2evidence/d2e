who have received two regimens of induction neoadjuvant chemotherapy before tumor resection pathological specimens of pre chemotherapy and post chemotherapy whatever retrievable will be collected the protein ad rna expression of dna repair genes ercc1 ercc2 xrcc1 xrcc3 brca1 and rrm1 as well as dna polymorphisms of these genes will be studied and will be correlate with the treatment response and outcome of the patients the aims of this study include 1 to identify the expression status of the above dna repair genes in taiwanese nsclc patients 2 to correlate the expression as well as dna polymorphism of each dna repair gene in treatment response to two differenct chemotherapeutic regimens 3 to correlate the expression as well as dna polymorphism of each dna repair gene in the outcome of stage iii nsclc patients 4 to explore whether platinum based chemotherapy will change the expression status of dna repair gene and if indeed changed whether this would influence the outcome of the patients patients with clinical stage iiia n2 non small cell lung cancer nsclc have a 5 year survival rate of 10% to 15% much worse than those of earlier stages of disease the use of pre operative neo adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be beneficial in several studies 1 however the precise chemotherapeutic regimen for neoadjuvant therapy remains an open question the treatment response and toxicity of chemotherapy vary widely among and within individuals and races recently molecular predictive markers may help to identify who may benefit from individual therapy many evidence shows that the level of ercc1 an excision nuclease within the nucleotide excision repair pathway is important for the repair of platinum dna adducts and the response to platinum based chemotherapy 2 5 not only

differential modulator of survival with cisplatin and antimicrotubule drugs paclitaxel docetaxel and vinorelbine low level of brca1 enhance cisplatin activity but lead to resistance to paclitaxel docetaxel and vinorelbine whereas the opposite phenomenon is observed in the presence of normal or high levels of brca1 in contract brca1 levels do not influence the effect of gemcitabine10 on the contrary rrm1 ribonucleotid reductase subunit m1 is involved in gemcitabine metabolism and dna repair after chemotherapy damage and increased rrm1 mrna expression has been related to gemcitabine

of the bilateral feet with 2 femoral pulses and palpable dp and pt pulses bilaterally with right greater than left there was no evidence of cellulitis with a necrotic left fourth toe hospital course 1 vascular the patient was admitted for the left fourth toe amputation which occurred on may this wound was left open she tolerated the procedure well with a vac change occurring on november at the bedside at that time it was noted that although there was pink granulation tissue the fifth toe had become ischemic and nonviable therefore the patient was taken to the operating room on november for a left fifth toe amputation which was also left open that was tolerated well but did not seem to be viable secondary to ischemia and infection therefore on january 2002 she was taken to the operating room for a left transmetatarsal amputation of the third fourth and fifth toes dressing changes wet to dry were done during that time it was noted that additional necrotic debris at the lateral aspect of the foot required more debridement so she was taken to surgery on may for debridement and a partial resection of the left fifth metatarsal a vac was placed and changed on january at the bedside on march 2002 the wound was felt to be clean enough and a split thickness skin graft was placed on the left foot 75 square cm and the donor site was the left thigh this seemed to be taking well we continued with dressing changes and a heat lamp to the donor site which healed well on february 2002 we took her to the operating room again for debridement of the left foot the plantar aspect of the skin graft had become discolored and we felt the infection required debridement intraoperatively the bone did not seem to be involved and at this point we had been continuing wet to dry dressing changes and as of march 2002 the plan was to take the patient to the operating room on march 2002 for another skin graft now that the wound is clean she has completed antibiotics 2 neurological the patient has a history of a seizure disorder which has been stable on gabitril she is status post stroke and is stable for her depression she receives prozac her pain is well controlled on a fentanyl patch with oxycodone for p r n pain and dilaudid for breakthrough pain the patient also has occasional dizziness and this is treated with p r n meclizine 3 cardiovascular the patient has coronary artery disease and is status post a myocardial infarction and hypertension which is currently well controlled on lopressor 50 mg t i d 4 respiratory the patient has asthma that has been stable and not evidenced in the hospital 5 gi the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease which is treated with esomeprazole she is on a diabetic diet she receives colace senna multivitamins folic acid and niferex 6 gu the patient is receiving lasix 100 mg b i d at this moment her admission creatinine was 0 7 peaked at 2 0 on february at which time we called a renal consultation who said she was probably pre renal acute renal failure secondary to ace inhibitor lasix and a new bunch of antibiotics at that time we held the ace inhibitor held the lasix and renally dosed the antibiotics at which time her creatinine came down to 1 1 which is closer to her baseline we have slowly restarted lasix and she has tolerated that we have since discontinued her antibiotics 7 heme the patient ' s admission hematocrit was 25 7 for which she received 1 unit of packed red blood cells on may she received another unit of packed red blood cells on june and her most recent hematocrit on march was 26 8 therefore she is baseline anemic 8 infectious disease this has been another major issue for this patient starting from the beginning on march the patient had a urinary tract infection with mixed flora for which she was treated with a five day course of diflucan for candida on may a wound culture of the left foot showed pseudomonas which was resistant to multiple drugs multidrug resistant e coli and methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus as well as multidrug resistant klebsiella on february when we went to the operating room for further debridement of the left foot we obtained deep cultures from the operating room and found pseudomonas diphtheroid and klebsiella which were sensitive to vancomycin and cefotaxime infectious disease had consulted on our patient and recommended vancomycin cefepime and flagyl and a two week course of these antibiotics for a soft tissue infection it did not appear in the operating room again that the bone was involved in the infection an mri on november however showed soft tissue swelling in the sinus tract that was suspicious for osteomyelitis of the fifth metatarsal but in consultation with infectious disease vascular surgery her operative findings and clinical picture we decided it looked more like a soft tissue infection and treated her for two weeks with antibiotics 9 endocrine the patient has diabetes mellitus and her blood sugar control has been an issue throughout her hospital stay slowly titrating up to her current lantus dose of 150 units subq q h s she seems to be doing well with that 10 ophthalmology the patient is status post bilateral cataract surgery and attempted filter for glaucoma in the right eye and high pressure with pain and proliferative retinopathy with bilateral traction detachment she was taking the following medications pred forte cosopt ofloxacin and alphagan for her eyes on november she had an ophthalmology appointment for floaters and that diagnosis was proliferative diabetic retinopathy status post pan retinal phototherapy with vitreous hemorrhage on march she had an appointment with dr saulsbury at 506 198 7227 who recommended to add timolol to her eye drops and will be following up with her 11 dental the patient had an appointment on august where they recommended a root canal of 18 and 19 for caries this root canal was done on march the number of the clinic is 101 719 8131 12 skin the patient received lotrimin miconazole and wound care to her right foot with regranex the left foot is receiving wet to dries q d 13 tubes lines and drains the patient had a right picc line placed on march 2002 discharge instructions neurological continue cardiac continue respiratory continue gi continue gu continue with monitoring of creatinine heme continue with monitoring of

blood sugar control ophthalmology she need follow up with her ophthalmologist about her retinopathy bilateral detachment and glaucoma dental she had a root canal done and will need follow up vascular will need to follow her bilateral extremity examination and the skin graft to her left foot to ensure proper healing as well she will be needing rehabilitation secondary to weakness and decreased mobility after these amputations she is heel weight bearing on the left weight bearing as tolerated on the right goals will be to have bed mobility transfers daily therapy with exercise and the goal

electrocardiogram was consistent with an old ekg from 2004 normal sinus rhythm at 82 now with slightly increased widening of the qrs complex in a left bundle branch block pattern hyperacute t waves in v4 and v3 impression a 68 year old gentleman with multiple medical problems and bilateral brachial plexopathy of unclear etiology now improving who presents with new right upper lobe infiltrate in the presence of having an indwelling picc line in place for iv antibiotics over the past three weeks as well as a bioprosthetic valve hospital course by system 1 infectious disease the patient was admitted for likely hospital acquired pneumonia given his long hospitalization and rehabilitation stays recently the patient was pancultured the picc line was discontinued and the tip was cultured the patient was covered broadly initially with vancomycin as well as ceftazidime on further review of the culture data during the hospital course the patient began to grow coagulase negative staphylococcus that was resistant to methicillin from both the picc line culture as well his blood cultures from 10 13 05 his chest ct was significant for an extensive area of ground glass opacity in the right upper lobe with smaller areas in other lobes bilateral mediastinal adenopathy was noted infection was thought to be the most likely diagnosis in view of the rapidity of the chest film changes other possibilities included bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma or lymphoma per the radiologic read but was not consistent with the clinical presentation per infectious disease consultation the pneumonia could be attributed to the mrse picc line bacteremia with secondary seating a subsequent transthoracic echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 55% 60% but with abnormal paradoxical motion consistent with his postoperative status after aortic valve replacement the entire anterior wall was hypokinetic the right ventricular systolic function appeared to be normal the left atrial size was mildly dilated at 4 6 cm the aortic valve appeared to be normal functioning with trace aortic regurgitation other valvular function appeared to be within normal limits with exception of moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation and peak systolic pulmonary artery pressures of 31 mmhg plus right atrial pressure no pericardial effusion was seen and no evidence of endocarditis was observed on follow up chest x rays throughout the hospital course the patient ' s infiltrate resolved with a chest x ray on 9 16 05 showing clear lungs and only prior cardiac surgery evident without worsening or continued presence of the right upper lobe infiltrate a new picc line was placed per infectious disease service recommendations for continued intravenous treatment with vancomycin for 7 to 10 days starting 48 hours after the last blood culture was negative therefore the last dose of his iv antibiotics should be given on 2 13 05 to cover other gram negative sources for his pneumonia the infectious disease service also suggested continuing and ceftazidime treatment as well therefore the patient will be discharged on both intravenous vancomycin as well as intravenous ceftazidime treatment because of the patient ' s inability to pay for the visiting nurses to administer iv antibiotics at home the patient will be discharged to a rehabilitation center 2 cardiovascular ischemia given the patient ' s history of diabetes and shortness of breath the patient was ruled out for myocardial infarction with three negative cardiac enzymes the patient was continued on his anti ischemic regimen including aspirin statin as well as beta blockade in the future the patient should be transitioned back to once a day dosing of beta blockade as an outpatient pump the patient initially presented in mild volume overload the patient was maintained on his home dosing of lasix with good volume response by the end of his hospitalization the patient was not requiring any oxygen supplementally and was discharged with euvolemia rhythm the patient was admitted initially in normal sinus rhythm status post cardioversion for atrial fibrillation he remained on coumadin he was placed on telemetry given some increased widened intervals of his qrs complexes early in the course of his hospitalization the patient converted back to atrial fibrillation his rate was controlled with beta blockade the sternta center and was asked to comment the patient was maintained on both beta blockade as well as digoxin he also continued on anticoagulation with coumadin interestingly the cardiovascular service suggested that possibly some ground glass opacities on the patient ' s chest ct could be attributed to amiodarone lung toxicity because of this finding it was recommended that the patient stop the amiodarone which was indeed discontinued through this hospitalization he should follow up with his cardiovascular group as an outpatient to determine further course of treatment for his atrial fibrillation anticoagulation the patient will continue to be treated with coumadin for goal inr between 2 to 3 by the end of this hospitalization the patient ' s inr was 1 7 on a dose of coumadin 7 mg p o q h s that dose was increased to 7 5 mg p o q h s the patient should have his inr checked within two days after discharge and have his coumadin dose changed appropriately 3 neurologic the patient was admitted on a previous hospitalization with a history of bilateral brachioplexopathy it had been attributed to possible line infection given a history of a tick bite he was treated empirically with three weeks of iv cefotaxime with moderate improvement of motor function while at rehabilitation interestingly upon further review of lyme disease workup the patient apparently had a negative serology for treponema pallidum igg confirmatory tests which included a lyme disease titer was still marked as pending in our computer system at the ardbroo worth son bu elstownw raph hospitals despite multiple attempts to try to contact the laboratory which runs this particular tests we were unable to confirm or deny the presence of past lyme infection therefore at this time we can only state that his bilateral brachioplexopathy was secondary to an unknown and unclear etiology fortunately with physical therapy and with time and possibly with infusion of the iv cefotaxime the patient ' s motor function has improved at the time of this discharge the patient ' s overall upper extremity motor strength was 4 5 symmetrically the patient should follow up very closely with his primary care physician as well as his neurologist in one month at that time his neurologist should confirm or negate the possibility that the patient ' s neurologic symptoms may have been caused by lyme disease the patient should continue physical therapy at rehabilitation and as an outpatient in addition the patient should continue his neurontin taper he currently is on 100 mg p o t i d and should be tapered to nothing by the end of his hospitalization and rehabilitation he will continue on methadone for his chronic pain in addition he suffers from significant anxiety he will be discharged on p r n ativan at low dose as higher doses tend to make him sleepier and oversedated 4 endocrine the patient was admitted with diabetes mellitus he was initially admitted with taking metformin 1000 mg p o q a m and 500 mg p o q h s because of his hospitalization and multiple studies this was discontinued transiently and he was placed on a regular insulin sliding scale at the end of this hospitalization he will be placed back on those home doses of metformin in addition he will continue his ace inhibitor for his diabetes as well as for his significant cardiac disease 5 pulmonary much of his pulmonary process can be attributed to his pneumonia as treated in the statements above in addition he will continue on p r n atrovent and albuterol nebulizer treatment for possible wheezing during his hospitalization in addition it is hoped that the ativan p r n dosing also contribute to less subjective shortness of breath secondary to alleviation of his anxiety 6 gastrointestinal the patient periodically throughout his hospitalization complained of mild epigastric pain a kub showed no perforation and no obvious obstruction but with many loops of bowel with stool he was placed on a bowel regimen including colace senna and dulcolax p r n by the end of this hospitalization he appeared to be less symptomatic in addition he will continue his trial of simethicone p r n for abdominal gas and bloating he will continue on his proton pump inhibitor nexium 40 mg p o q d code status he remains full code throughout his hospitalization disposition the patient will be discharged to rehabilitation where he will continue iv antibiotic support for until 2 13 05 he should also continue physical therapy for his upper extremity motor dysfunction he should follow up with his primary care physician as well as his neurologist as stated in his discharge summary discharge medications include tylenol 650 mg p o q 4h p r n headache aspirin 325 mg p o q d
