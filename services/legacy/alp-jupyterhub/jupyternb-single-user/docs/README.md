## Pointers about `docs` folder
1. Please <b>do not</b> create any files inside the docs folder. As they will not be persisted the next time you login.

2. To view the pyqe/index.html file, please right click on html file -> open with -> Select HTML Viewer

3. In the documentation `pyqe/index.html`, the links of the modules index on the left will not work for the time being due to limitation of javascript being disabled on jupyterhub. However the index is still useful as a reference to show the available modules within pyqe and can be searched for them in the main content of the documentation. 

4. Files created with __ will be ignored from backup.
