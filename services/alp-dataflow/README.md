# ALP Dataflow

Manage Dataflow from ALP Portal and transform dataflows into parameters for Prefect flow runs

## Description

Service is based on [Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework.

### Why NestJS
- Framework for developers to create NodeJS applications using modular design patterns
- Follows a well-defined/opinionated architecture (Controller > Service > Repository / Provider)
- Decorator support (which allows reusable code like validation to be easily applied)
- Writing unit tests are easy due to dependency injection & use of Nest CLI
- Code structure is clean, maintainable, testable
