##### Instructions for version upgrade in Logto

- Change the logto version in `services/alp-logto/Dockerfile` and `services/alp-logto/Dockerfile.local`
```
# in Dockerfile
FROM ghcr.io/logto-io/logto:1.18

# in Dockerfile.local
RUN git clone --branch v1.18.0 https://github.com/logto-io/logto.git /etc/logto
```

- D2E has a custom version of `experience` package that should replace the original version at the path `/etc/logto/packages/experience`. Steps to generate the custom experience package are as follows:
    - Go through `Dockerfile.local` and update it with any relevant changes according to the publicly available logto [Dockerfile](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/blob/master/Dockerfile)
    - Build and run the image locally with the help of [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/logto-io/logto/blob/master/docker-compose.yml)
    - copy the experience package from the container (created in the previous step) to the D2E repo replacing the [experience.zip](services/alp-logto/experience.zip)

- With these changes building the [Dockerfile](services/alp-logto/Dockerfile) will ensure Logto is upgraded to the required version as well as custom experience pacakge is available in it
